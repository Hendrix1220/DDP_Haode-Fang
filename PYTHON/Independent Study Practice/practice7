"""
Date Scheduler Function

Objective:
Write a function named 'date_passed' to determine the relationship between two dates.

Function Parameters:
1. todays_date (string): The current date in the format 'day Month'.
2. scheduled_date (string): The scheduled date to compare, in the same format.

Instructions:
- The function should compare todays_date and scheduled_date and print whether the scheduled date has passed, is yet to pass, or is today.
- Assume the dates are in the same year.
- The dates are in a format like '26th March'. Consider how to convert these for comparison.
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp

Example Test Cases:
1. date_passed('26th March', '25th March') should indicate that the scheduled date has passed.
2. date_passed('26th March', '26th March') should indicate that the scheduled date is today.
3. date_passed('26th March', '27th March') should indicate that the scheduled date is yet to pass.

from datetime import datetime
def date_passed(todays_date, scheduled_date):
    date_format = "%dth %B" #先定义日期原始的格式 
    today = datetime.strptime(todays_date, date_format)#strptime的用途就是把不同类型的日期格式转换数值型 注意的是后面两个参数 分别是 元变量以及被转换的形式
    scheduled = datetime.strptime(scheduled_date, date_format)#datetime导入  用strptime时候一定是datetime.strptime 原先的变量放在后面括号里面呢
    if today < scheduled:
        print("The scheduled date is yet to pass.")
    elif today > scheduled:
        print("The scheduled date has passed.")
    else:
        print("The scheduled date is today.")
    # Your code goes here
    # Implement the logic to compare the dates and print the appropriate message
    


# Test cases
date_passed("26th March", "25th March")  # Expected: Scheduled date has passed
date_passed("26th March", "26th March")  # Expected: Scheduled date is today
date_passed("26th March", "27th March")  # Expected: Scheduled date is yet to pass
